# Project

## Bubble Tea Comparisons and Rankings across 11 Major US Cities

### Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate how bayesian (weighted) rankings for goods/services compares to typical non-weighted rankings for goods/services

### Motivation
While simple, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn several things: 
1) Procure my own dataset on a subject I'm curious about/Collect data that hasn't been readily compiled online
2) Write my own webscraping script and experience the technical aspect of collecting data
3) Wrangle data using Python + relevant libraries/Produce data transformations that I normally do in Excel, SQL, and Alteryx but in Python
4) Have an end product that can be neatly visualized

### Challenges
Ran into some issues with creating the Python function that can scroll down to the bottom of a query page in Google Maps. Workaround required a slight manual element

### Documents and Deliverables
1. Web scraping jupyter notebook
2. Data cleaning/wrangling jupyter notebook
3. Analysis jupyter notebook
4. Piktochart infographic (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayesongao/)

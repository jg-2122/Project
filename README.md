# Project

## Bubble Tea Comparisons and Rankings across 11 Major US Cities

###### Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate how a bayesian rating system works for goods/services and how incorporating weight to the volume of ratings could provide a more accurate reflection of ratings compare to each other.

###### Motivation
While simple, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn several things: 
1) Procure my own dataset on a subject I'm curious about/Collect data that hasn't been readily compiled online
2) Write my own webscraping script and experience the technical aspect of collecting data
3) Wrangle data using Python + relevant libraries/Produce data transformations that I normally do in Excel, SQL, and Alteryx but in Python
4) Have an end product that can be neatly visualized

###### Challenges
Ran into some issues with creating a Python function that can scroll down to the bottom of a query page in Google Maps. Workaround required a slight manual element

###### Documents and Deliverables
1. Web scraping jupyter notebook
2. Data cleaning/wrangle jupyter notebook
3. Piktochart infographic
